# 001 Domain model

This document names the concepts of dsh-superagent and the rules each one keeps. The code, the tools the agents call, the panel and the other documents use these terms and no others. Following [000 Philosophy](000-philosophy.md), the model holds only concepts the work needs, and a business need becomes an attribute of one of them.

## Flow

Work moves from Trigger to Eval to execution. A Source produces Triggers. A Trigger fans out as context to the Tickets subscribed to its Threads. A person's message that reached a Ticket this way stays with that Ticket; every other Trigger enters Eval, which decides whether it asks for new work. When Eval accepts, it creates a Ticket with a Mandate. An Assignment hands the Ticket to an Executor, and results go back to the Source through a Channel.

## Concepts

Source, Thread, Eval, Mandate and Subscription form the core domain; the rest supports them.

| Concept | Definition | Rules it keeps | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source | A stream of events. A Source kind is a reusable implementation; a Source instance is one configuration of a kind: whether it runs and what it listens to | Holds its read position and its own bot identity. Defines what counts as an event, including conditions that only hold over time. Drops the bot's own messages and Triggers outside what it listens to before they enter the domain. Translates each Trigger into the Threads it belongs to and the Channel addresses to reply on | A restart must not replay events |
| Trigger | One immutable event with the Source's own metadata, such as its actor | Belongs to one or more Threads. Accepting a Trigger twice creates one Ticket | The unit of audit and of idempotence |
| Thread | Triggers in time order; the Source defines which Triggers form one Thread | At most one Eval runs on it at a time. It may have several Tickets. It holds its Subscriptions, the running Eval and its Decision history | Gives Eval a consistent view and its context |
| Correlation | The relation between Threads that one Trigger belongs to | Adds context; never routes | Lets Eval follow related evidence |
| Channel | The write side of a Thread; the Source defines its addresses | A Thread may have several Channels; a Ticket holds a set of them | Acknowledgements, replies, pull requests and resolved reviews are all writes |
| Policy | The versioned assessment rules and each Source's part: who may originate work through that Source, in that Source's own identities, how the list is synchronized, and which bots may make candidates | The Policy version covers the rules, the accept mode and the Source parts. A change that bears on a live Ticket, such as a change to a rule it was accepted under, is delivered to its Assignment; it does not revoke Mandates. Identities on different Sources are never mapped to each other | When the rules change, a running Eval must be discarded |
| Eval | The judgement on a batch of Triggers, in two layers: gate and assessment | Input: the Trigger batch, a Thread snapshot, every Ticket on the Thread including ended ones, and the current Policy. Output: a Decision. Holds no state | Decides whether new work starts, goes on or stops |
| Mandate | What an accept grants: the Policy version, the scope, the strength, the matched rules, the sender's identity on that Source and how the Source received the Trigger | Immutable; wider scope means a new Ticket. A Ticket's end does not end it: only a person's stop withdraws it, and a Policy that no longer holds it revokes it. Revalidated against the current Policy before an ended Ticket resumes | States why the work may be done, and how far it may go |
| Ticket | A unit of authorized work | Only Eval creates one. Refers to its Mandate; holds its Channels and Inputs. Goes open → ended, and back to open when a person's message on one of its Threads resumes it, unless a person stopped it. Defines its own state instead of following the Executor's | Owns the execution and its reports |
| Assignment | The binding of a Ticket to one Executor instance | A Ticket has several over time. Goes pending → running → ended independently of the Ticket. Only its final report may end the Ticket on the Executor's side | The Executor is outside the domain, but who executes must be inside it |
| Subscription | A many-to-many relation between Tickets and Threads, held by the Thread | A matching Trigger fans out to every live subscribed Ticket, with no check of who sent it; a person's message that reaches a Ticket this way takes no Eval. A Thread an Executor follows for context reaches its Ticket the same way, but lends it no authority and does not resume it. An ended Ticket keeps its Subscriptions, including that of a pull request that closed or merged: a person's message resumes it under the same Mandate, with no Eval or Decision; messages from bots and CI do not reach it, since its Executor reads its Threads again when it resumes. A Ticket a person stopped receives nothing. The main Session attaches a Thread to an existing Ticket only when its message points at that Ticket explicitly. A person can drop every Subscription on a Thread; an Executor can drop only its own Ticket's Subscription to a Thread it finds unrelated, except the Thread its Ticket started on and a Thread a Source made it follow, such as its pull request's | Later discussion reaches the Executor without anyone mentioning the agent again |

A person is not a domain concept. A Trigger carries its actor's identifier as the Source gives it. An allowed list is a Source's part of the Policy, in that Source's identities. That one person has accounts on several Sources is prompt text that the agents read when they need it.

The Executor, with its Sessions and directories, is outside the domain and connects through Assignments.

Aggregates: a Source holds its read position. A Thread holds its Subscriptions, its running Eval, which runs serially and merges Triggers that arrive meanwhile into the next batch, and its Decision history. A Ticket holds its Assignments, Channels and Inputs, and refers to Decisions by id.

## Rejected concepts

| Rejected | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Principal or Membership as an entity, or mapping identities across Sources | A person is Trigger metadata; an allowed list is a Source's part of the Policy; a cross-Source mapping is prompt text |
| Eval scheduling its own delayed Triggers | A condition that needs waiting is an ordinary Source, so Eval never depends back on Sources |
| Waiting or revoked Eval states | Waiting belongs to Sources; an Eval that runs out of time queues its Triggers again, or ends `unavailable` |
| At most one live Ticket per Thread | One Thread can carry several independent pieces of work; the assessment avoids duplicates from the Ticket list |
| An "append to Ticket" Decision | Appending is Subscription fan-out and needs no Eval |
| Admission checks on Subscriptions | A Subscription covers the whole Thread; the Mandate separates authorization from context |
| Correlation that routes | Subscriptions route; Correlation only adds context |
| Ticket state that follows the DSH Session | A Ticket can be handed off, resumed, or run by several Executors, so it defines its own state |
| An Executor declaring that a person asked it to stop | Only Eval decides the strength of an end |
| Cancelling running Tickets on a Policy change | A cancelled change leaves half-finished work; the change is recorded and delivered instead |
| Locking all of an Executor Session's tools when it fails or blocks | It would refuse a person working directly in the Session, and the report after recovery; pausing automatic input is enough |
| Inferring "waiting on a person" from a report's free text | The classification needs structured facts; the Executor asks through a structured field |

## What is reusable

The concepts above and their rules are reusable. The Source implementations, the Policy contents, the Executor and the Channel implementations belong to a deployment. Each Source keeps its own words internally, such as message, chat or notification, and translates them into Triggers.

| Part | In this repository |
| --- | --- |
| Source | Feishu: live events, history recovery, polling of subscribed topics. GitHub: notifications, subscribed Issues and pull requests, CI changes, pull requests merged or closed, and, where switched on, every new Issue, pull request and comment in the repository and the default branch's CI |
| Policy | Assessment rules, and each Source's allowed list, its sync, its bot list and its admission table |
| Executor | A DSH Executor Session and a directory per Ticket, in an execution environment whose variables the Executor and the Sources register |
| Channel | Feishu topic replies, GitHub comments and review thread replies |
